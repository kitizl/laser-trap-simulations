# Laser Trap Simulations

A repository containing simulations and statistics to study nanosphere dynamics in laser traps

---


# Download

Download the repository using `git clone https://github.com/kitizl/laser-trap-simulations`. You will need Julia to run the .jl files and Python to run the .py files. This is meant for scientific computation, so it is assumed that you have a sufficiently up to date scientific package distribution, such as Anaconda.

# Usage
The structure of this repository will soon change and therefore, the usage documentation will be updated then.
